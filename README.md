This repository is my attempt at demystifying machine learning algorithms. Each section of this repository will contain an explanatory notebook in which I will try my very best to explain the mathematical intuition behind the ML algorithm. In conjunction with that, a bare-bones Numpy implementation of the algorithm will also be developed.

This repository will always be a work in progress, and I will add new algorithms as I go.
