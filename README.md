This repository is my attempt at demystifying machine learning algorithms, each section of this repository will contain an explanatory notebook in which I will try my very best at explaining the mathematical intuition behind the ML algorithm and in conjunction with that a bare bones Numpy implementation of the algorithm will also be developed.

This repository will always be a work in progress and i will add new algorithm as i go.
